# Website-Blocker

## Description
It is a simple application built using Python and Tkinter library that allows users to block or unblock websites on their system. It provides a user-friendly interface to block specific websites during specified hours, helping users to improve productivity or control access to certain websites.

## Features
- Block a Website: Users can input URLs to block and submit them. The application will add these URLs to the block list, preventing access to those websites.
- Unblock a Website: Users can select URLs from a dropdown list to unblock them, restoring access to previously blocked websites.
- Scheduling: Blocking and unblocking of websites can be scheduled to occur only during specific hours, providing flexibility and control over website access.
